# Support Vector Machine Breast Cancer PredictionÂ¶
For this project we will be exploring breast cancer dataset from Scikit Learn. Using Support Vector Machines algorithm

Column Information: 
radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter area smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
