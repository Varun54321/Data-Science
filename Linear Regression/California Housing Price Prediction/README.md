<h1><b>Linear Regression Project: California Housing Price Prediction</b></h1>
A real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for california. Task is to create a model for her that allows to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for. I decided that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem! The agent gives some information about a bunch of houses in regions of the United States,it is all in the data set: ("California_Housing.csv").

<h3><b>The data contains the following columns:</b></h3>
longitude (signed numeric - float) : Longitude value for the block in California, USA

latitude (numeric - float ) : Latitude value for the block in California, USA

housing_median_age (numeric - int ) : Median age of the house in the block

total_rooms (numeric - int ) : Count of the total number of rooms (excluding bedrooms) in all houses in the block
